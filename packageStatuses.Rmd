# Maintainers

The package maintainers have final responsibility and authority over their respective packages. Only a maintainer may create a new release (following the [release process](releaseProcess.html)), accept pull requests, and push to the master branch.

# Package life cycle

We currently distinguish the following stages in a package life cycle:

1. **Candidate**: The R package is being considered for inclusion in the OHDSI Methods Library, but does not yet meet all requirements.
2. **Methods Library**: The package meets all requirements for inclusion in the Methods Library, and is recommended for use in OHDSI community studies.
3. **CRAN**: The package is available in CRAN.

## Requirements for packages in the Methods Library

For a package to be eligible for admission to the OHDSI Methods Library, it should meet the following criteria:

1. Adhere to all guidelines documented on this site.

2. For those interacting with data: run on all database platforms supported by OHDSI (e.g. PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, Amazon RedShift)

3. For population-level effect estimation methods: must be evaluated using the OHDSI Methods Benchmark.

The final decision for including a package in the Methods Library lies with the leaders of the OHDSI [Patient-Level Prediction Workgroup](https://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=projects:workgroups:patient-level_prediction) and [Population-Level Estimation Workgroup](https://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=projects:workgroups:est-methods).

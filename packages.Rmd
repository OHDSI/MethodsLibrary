# Population-level estimation

The methods library consists of a set of R packages that can be used to execute observational studies against data in the Common Data Model (CDM) format. The following packages are available:

## `r icon::fa("cube")`  CohortMethod
New-user cohort studies using large-scale regression for propensity and outcome models


## `r icon::fa("cube")`  SelfControlledCaseSeries
Self-Controlled Case Series analysis using few or many predictors, includes splines for age and seasonality.


## `r icon::fa("cube")`  SelfControlledCohort
A self-controlled cohort design, where time preceding exposure is used as control.


## `r icon::fa("cube")`  CaseControl
Case-control studies, matching controls on age, gender, provider, and visit date. Allows nesting of the study in another cohort.


## `r icon::fa("cube")`  CaseCrossover
including the option to adjust for time-trends in exposures (so-called case-time-control).


# Patient-Level prediction


## `r icon::fa("cube")` PatientLevelPrediction
Build and evaluate predictive models for user-specified outcomes, using a wide array of machine learning algorithms.

# Method characterization

## `r icon::fa("cube")` EmpiricalCalibration
Use negative and positive control exposure-outcome pairs to profile and calibrate a particular analysis design.


## `r icon::fa("cube")`  MethodEvaluation
Use real data and established reference sets to evaluate the performance of methods.


## `r icon::fa("cube")`  EvidenceSynthesis
Combining study diagnostics and results across multiple sites.


# Supporting packages

## `r icon::fa("cube")`  Cyclops
Highly efficient implementation of regularized logistic, Poisson and Cox regression.


## `r icon::fa("cube")`  FeatureExtraction
Automatically extract large sets of features for user-specified cohorts using data in the CDM.


## `r icon::fa("cube")` DatabaseConnector


## `r icon::fa("cube")` SqlRender
Generate SQL on the fly for the various SQL dialects.

## `r icon::fa("cube")` ParallelLogger
An R package for easy parallel computing, logging, and function call automation.

# Adding methods

We are always looking for new methods and packages to add to the Methods Libary. However, in order to qualify for inclusion a package must meet the following requirements:

- Pass R check without warnings or notes.
- Adhere to [OHDSI's code style guidelines](https://ohdsi.github.io/MethodsLibrary/contribute.html#code_style_guidelines) and overall development practices.
- Have [unit tests](http://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=development:unit_testing_in_r) that test the package's most important routines.
- For population-level estimation methods: be evaluated using the OHDSI Methods Benchmark.

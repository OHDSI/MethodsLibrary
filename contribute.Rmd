# Adding methods

We are always looking for new methods and packages to add to the Methods Libary. However, in order to qualify for inclusion a package must meet the following requirements:

- Pass R check without warnings or notes.
- Adhere to OHDSI's code style guidelines and overall development practices.
- Have unit tests that test the package's most important routines.
- For population-level estimation methods: be evaluated using the OHDSI Methods Benchmark.
